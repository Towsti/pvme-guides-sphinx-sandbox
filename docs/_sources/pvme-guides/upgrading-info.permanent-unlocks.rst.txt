Permanent Unlocks  
-----------------








|643505116347105290.png| |643505153709965322.png| |643505179378974748.png| |<b>| Berserk Auras |</b>|

- Costs |704701746869567551.png| 25,000 Marks of War

- BIS auras at most places, they last 30 minutes but are extended to 1 hour via vis wax. Provide the following buffs:

      - These auras provide an invisible 10% boost to the player's melee/magic/range damage and accuracy respectively; this does not stack with damage boosting ultimates

      - The respective combat level is also increased by 10%. With a supreme overload, this results in a level of 128

      - You will also receive 15% more melee, magic, ranged and soft typeless damage. Hard typeless is unaffected

      - In addition to this your defence level is reduced by 15%

- They should be used in any bossing encounter where you do not have 100% accuracy; and optionally any time you wish to deal more damage with a specific style  

- Priority: ``High``

      - These should be the first auras you unlock, start with the combat style you use the most then move on to the remaining two before getting other auras






|643505376917979138.png| |643505377211842582.png| |643505377291534366.png| |<b>| Accuracy Auras |</b>|

- Costs |704657054987452447.png| 107,000 Loyalty Points per aura (cumulative cost for supreme variant)

- Increase melee/magic/range accuracy by 3%/5%/7%/10% per rank respectively. They last 1 hour by default and can be extended to 2 hours

- Reasonable option if zerk auras are on cooldown and you do not have 100% accuracy

- Priority: ``Low`` Only get these after you have all berserk auras, either way these will likely see little use






|643148943856762890.png| |643505652571963417.png| |<b>| Mahjarrat & Dark Magic Aura |</b>|

- Dark Magic costs |704701746869567551.png| 12,500 Marks of War

- Mahjarrat costs either |704657943194501140.png| 1000 Reaper Points or |513213538463121408.png| 3 Bonds

- Mahjarrat provides a 5% damage boost and Dark magic deals damage over time to your target

- These are used in cases where you hybrid and already have 100% accuracy

- Priority: ``Medium, High if you intend to camp solak/Elite dungeons``



|643505652634746881.png| |643505652865695767.png| |<b>| Inspiration & Invigorate Aura |</b>|

- Inspiration costs |704657054987452447.png| 23,000 Loyalty Points

- Invigorate costs |704657054987452447.png| 115,000 Loyalty Points (cumulative cost for supreme variant)

- Inspiration causes successful attacks to give an extra 0.5% adrenaline. Invigorate saves 2.5%/5%/7.5%/10% adrenaline after an ultimate; this effect stacks with a ring of vigour

- These auras can be used as a last resort option for bosses you already have 100% accuaracy. Alternatively they can be used for elite dungeons or slayer, but are still inferior to berserk auras

- Priority: ``Medium/Low``



|643505653062565907.png| |643505653079343144.png| |<b>| Penance & Vampyrism Aura |</b>|

- Vampyrism costs |704701746869567551.png| 5,000 Marks of War

- Penance costs |704657054987452447.png| 23,000 Loyalty Points

- Penance restores prayer points equal to 5% of any damage taken, rounded down.

- Vampyrism restores life points equal to 5% of any damage dealt; this is capped at 50 life points per hit.

- Very low usage for bossing and are mainly used for slayer

       - Crackling deals 50% ability damage per rank every 60 seconds

       - Precise increases your minimum damage by 1.5% per rank of your maximum damage.

       - Planted Feet causes the duration of Sunshine and Death's Swiftness to be increased by 25%

       - Aftershock deals additional AoE damage for every 50,000 damage the player deals

- These basic perks should be used in any general combat scenario as they are unlocked early and provide a substantial boost to DPS

|580177869284835328.png| |<b>| Max Cape Perks |</b>|

- The max and comp capes can fit 3 perks, and the combatants cape can fit two. Generally, the following perks should be prioritized:

      - |689509250979987525.png| This is a must, as it acts as a sign of life and frees up your pocket slot for much more useful items. It also saves you an inventory slot as you do not need portent of life.

      - |689509250879324165.png| Dismember hits 3 more times (from 5 to 8), effectively increasing its damage by 60%. Very powerful with Lunging perk. Only useful if meleeing, can skip if you do not melee.

      - |689509250887712902.png| Useful for healing at bank as well as regen throughout fights, though the effect is rather minimal. Scales with maximum HP.

      - |689504724403486920.png| Ammo proc chance is increased by 20%. For example, the base chance of ruby bakriminel (e) proccing is 5%. This cape boosts it to 6% (20% of 5% is +1%). Only useful if ranging, can skip if you do not range.

	  - |689509250472476758.png| / |689509250946695292.png| The impact these have on upkeep costs is relatively minimal, and these capes are mostly just filler; the combatants cape cannot have invention on it.
