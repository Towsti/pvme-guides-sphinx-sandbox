===================

Preventing Walked Onslaughts  
----------------------------






In order to prevent yourself from walking your onslaught, simply hit an auto keybind before hitting your onslaught keybind. It will stop your movement and prevent you from walking out of your onslaught.






Slow hitting abilities (Courtesy of <@222668864704610305> and <@130322872089575424>)  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






In RS, there are some abilities whose damage will go through one tick after they are activated, and some abilities whose damage will delay. The latter are known as slow abilities, and are worth being aware of.

Additionally, for auto attacks, all surge spells and all blitz spells will hit a tick slow.

Additionally, most abilities hit slower when cast from a distance.

3-tick Snipe  
------------






- Requires ability queuing and nightmare gauntlets in order to work

- Essentially allows Snipe to be used like a non channelled ability on GCD however it will still hit at the same time as it normally would 

- Simply use Snipe, then queue up any other ability prior to GCD for example: Snipe -> Queue piercing shot. This will cause Piercing shot to come out on the following GCD after snipe instead of having to wait 4 ticks for the full channel of Snipe. 

- Substantial DPM increase for ranged although some players find it difficult to use queuing so use at your own benefit. 

- Useful pretty much every time you would snipe at any boss

- After you fire the queued ability off your character will be rooted in place for 1 tick

Demonstration: https://youtu.be/bd64iILPqJM


|https://youtu.be/bd64iILPqJM|



10 Second Needle Strike Buff  
----------------------------






- Requires 2 targets in order to work, normally a boss mob/dummy and then the boss itself

- Needle striking the 1st target (dummy/boss mob) and then targeting the 2nd target (the boss) and ammo swapping/mainhand swapping essentially allows the needle buff to persist past just the first attack you deal, instead it will last for 17 ticks meaning any non bleed ranged damage you deal for the next 17 ticks on that target will have the 7% needle buff.

- Can see that the entire rapidfire has the needle strike buff instead of just the first two hits, the following 3 abilities after the rapidfire would also have the needle strike buff as well

- Dealing damage to the target you originally needle striked will cancel the 10 second buff

- If you do not swap mainhands or ammo after needle striking the first target you will get no buff at all until you do so, the timer begins as soon as you needle the first target

- Useful for places like vorago p3s/p5s where you would have a dummy down and needle strike it prior to releasing thresholds on vorago, can also be used at AoD by needle striking reaver/pillars/amalgs

Weapon override speeding up abilities (Courtesy of <@158293690001915904>)  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Certain weapon overrides for ranged can cause abilities that normally take 2 ticks to deal damage to only take 1 tick to deal damage depending on your distance from your target. These abilities include snapshot |535534127131394088.png| , rapid fire |535541270521708566.png| , piercing shot |535541258538450944.png| , dazing shot |535541307142307860.png| , and ricochet |535541259566186521.png| slow abilities which are unaffected include: needle strike, binding shot, and tight bindings.

- Javelins (DW Override only mainhand required.) causes piercing and ricochet to hit fast from md-1sq away, snapshot and rapidfire are only fast in md. 

- Blowpipe (2H Override) causes dazing shot to hit fast from md-1sq away, rapid and snap are both fast from md-3sq away, and ricochet/piercing are fast from md-4sq away

- You can override your dualwield/2h weapons with these weapon types allowing you to take advantage of them causing certain abilities to hit a tick faster






Flanking Perk Angle Determination <@!242039053841596418>   
---------------------------------------------------------


If your target is facing directly north, east, south or west, flanking works only from a 90° or greater angle.

If your target is facing any other direction, flanking works from a 90-(90-the amount of degrees your target is from facing where you're standing)° angle.

In the below picture, black is your target, red is the direction your target is facing, and green is where flanking works.

Freedom Autos (Courtesy of <@425520655920791553>)  
-------------------------------------------------


Freedom is unique in the respect that it can be used to force an offhand auto as well as a 2h auto within 3t. This has many uses like freedom vuln (using vuln instead of the offhand auto loses less damage than if you were to do it in place of a 2h auto), as well as accelerated adren gain because you get also adren from 2 autos.



Mage: It's usually easier to time, and also often beneficial to do it immediately after a 2h abil, as this means the 2h auto comes at the same time as your next ability.



You do this as follows:


.. code:: none

    Tick 0: Activate abil with staff equipped

    Tick 0-3: Equip dual wield

    Tick 3: Click auto → freedom (you don't have to click the keybind for this auto if you just want a regular auto).

    Tick 4-6: Switch to staff

    Tick 6: Click auto → abil







You can see a clip of this here: https://youtu.be/3vIVqAYj4Xk

|https://youtu.be/3vIVqAYj4Xk|



For other styles you'll need to do it after a dual wield ability (or delay your ability afterwards but this isn't worthwhile):


.. code:: none

    Tick 0: Activate abil with dual wield equipped

    Tick 3: Activate freedom

    Tick 4: Equip 2h

    Tick 6: Activate abil







You can see a clip of this here: https://youtu.be/YydKrY05Kc8

|https://youtu.be/YydKrY05Kc8|



It's worth noting that if you're maging and freedom after a dual wield ability, to avoid losing autos you have to do a dual wield ability immediately after as well. Consider:


.. code:: none

    any abil → dw abil → freedom (oh + 2h auto) → dw abil → auto + staff abil

    staff abil → freedom (oh + 2h auto) → any abil → dw abil → auto + staff abil



If you just did a staff ability afterwards:


.. code:: none

    staff abil → dw abil → freedom (oh + 2h auto) → any abil → dw abil



you'd clearly lose an auto.



You can also use freedom to cancel a channelled ability. In order to do this you have to click the target on the same tick you use freedom, or you won't get the offhand auto off. You also have to delay your subsequent ability by 1 tick in order to get your 2h auto off.






Forcing an auto with defensives  
-------------------------------


When using a defensive, an auto attack will be fired. When using |689504724159823906.png| , this auto attack can be changed from a normal auto into a utility spell, such as |537349530551582720.png| or |567727987274022924.png| . This is done by pressing the keybind for |537349530551582720.png| or |567727987274022924.png| , followed by the keybind for |535541258240786434.png| , |535541306475151390.png| , |535541258844635148.png| , or |535541258546970624.png| .






Switching Weapons during Detonate (Courtesy of <@185315527571406848>)

During the detonate channel, it is possible to switch weapons without Detonate being released. It is also possible to channel shield dome inside detonate, provided detonate is pressed first. This will cost the auto on detonate release, but is situationally useful at Vorago. It is also worth noting that it's possible to Spellbook Swap in deto, allowing for a vuln release.

Shield Dome Detonate  
--------------------


In certain cases, most notably at Vorago, it is beneficial to be in shield dome while channelling detonate. This is done by channelling detonate, then channelling shield dome. This will result in a lost auto, but can be prevented by sipping a super restore or an overload salve to cancel the shield dome.

Dragon Battleaxe Spec  
---------------------


The Dragon battleaxe has a unique spec that is often used in speed kills due to providing a noticeable damage increase at the cost of a large amount of adrenaline, therefore is quite useful when prepared before hand or in other niche situations.



The Spec works as following, by draining 10% (rounded down) of your attack, range, magic, and defence levels, and you will be given a strength level boost of 10 + 1 level for every 4 drained from your other stats, as well as a hidden damage boost of 1.2x your damage, this also stacks with Zaros godsword spec going from a 1.25x to 1.5x boost, or 1.1x when under the effect of berserk, making berserk a 2.2x damage boost. This boost overall lasts 1 minute.



It’s most common uses are setup before hand for a speed/record kills where you will Dragon battleaxe in conjunction with natural instinct to make the most of the boost before going into the kill, or for an Araxxor p3 skip and certain 1 cycle core Solak rotations.






Bladed Dive Angle  
-----------------






After using Bladed Dive it will leave your character facing a consistent direction. It's important to be comfortable with this so you can Bladed Dive → Surge and move in a predictable manner. See this graphic courtesy of <@76883062381621248> for more information:
