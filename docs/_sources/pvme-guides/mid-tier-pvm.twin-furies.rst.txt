Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Twin Furies is a Zamorakian  boss located in the Heart of Gielinor (aka GWD2). Entering the boss fight requires 40 (or 20 kc if you have enough rep) and 80 ranged. Notable drops include the Crest of Zamorak, which is an ingredient for making T80 and T85 power armor, and the T85 blades.

The boss itself is the easiest of the four GWD2 fights. The boss is unique in the fact that both targets share the 200k hp pool. This means that an aoe attack will essentially do double damage. That being said, melee with a halberd style weapon is preferred.



**Ideal Auras:**  |berserker|  >  |dm| 



Weapons: A halberd range weapon should be used, as AoE melee abilities will hit both furies, effectively doing double damage.  |noxscythe|  >  |dragonriderlance| 



This boss also helps build the habit of using barge to move to your target as they start their special attacks, particularly for the 2nd and 3rd special attacks





Preset 
^^^^^^^

As stated earlier, halberd weapons shine here because of their range during the channeled bomb attack. 



Currently, DTB are used as Cinderbanes are bugged at Twin Furies. If you're struggling with food conservation and soulsplit is not enough to heal you, you may also use a scrimshaw of vampyrism to help sustain yourself for the full hour. Otherwise, an unactivated god book can remain in your pocket slot. An elite enhanced excalibur and ancient elven ritual shard are used to supplement your HP and prayer upkeep.

-  |adrenurn|   **Adrenaline urn** `Prevents adren loss after dropping combat, stores up to 1000% adrenaline`

-  |ancientshard|   **Ancient elven ritual shard** `Restores prayer overtime, 5 minute cooldown`

Mechanics
^^^^^^^^^



**Jumps**

Avaryss jumps towards the northern wall and charges down to the southern wall. She will repeat this attack a total of 4 times and will always travel in the cardinal directions (north to south, west to east, etc.). You may simply move out of the way after Avaryss jumps to a new wall. It is a good idea to use slaughter (or combust/fragmentation shot) on one of the twins during this special attack to get extra damage in. Any single link of this mechanic can be dealt with by using resonance for a free heal, but is not required to deal with the mechanic at all.



**Ceiling collapse**

In this phase, Nymora will jump to a random square in the arena and cause a ceiling collapse. You have to stand in the 3x3 area around her to negate the damage from the collapse. If you haven't used slaughter by now, you may use it on Avaryss while walking over to Nymora's special.



**Channeled bomb**

During this phase, the twins will jump to the center of the arena and channel a bomb attack. They take 2x damage during this special so using Berserk (or sunshine/death's swiftness) is ideal as it will speed up the kill greatly. During this special, you will take ticks of typeless damage which can easily be negated with soulsplit. If the channel finishes and the kill is not over, a bomb will detonate dealing 4,500 damage. During this phase, the twins stand close enough that cleave, hurricane and quake will hit both of them. Using these in a Berserk rotation will easily finish the kill for you.
