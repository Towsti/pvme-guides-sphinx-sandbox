Incense stick guide  
-------------------






Incense sticks are a consumable created by combining logs, ashes, and herbs. They have a variety of uses between skilling and combat, but we will only be covering those that have a pvm related boost. Each incense stick increases the buff duration by 10 minutes.

Incense sticks have a potency from 1-4. This increases by 1 every 10 minutes (30 minutes till max potency), or you can 'overload' and instantly boost to max potency at the cost of 6 sticks (still only 10 minutes added duration though). This would increase the cost for 1 hour to 11 incense sticks instead of just 6, but more sticks can be added to keep the boosts up indefinitely assuming your buff doesn't expire. Dying will cancel your incense boost as a whole causing you to have to re-incense, even if you use a ring of death or practice mode. In practice, overloading instantly is almost always better.

You can have up to 3 different effects active at once at 95 firemaking.

The relevant incense sticks with pvm benefits are listed as follows:

- |RanarrSticks+690987265186594857| Ranarr: Each potency level gives a +1 prayer bonus (functionally useless)

- |SpiritSticks+565726489136463894| Spirit Weed: Each potency level provides a 10% increased familiar special attack recovery rate

- |IritSticks+690987265371144202| Irit: Each potency level reduces poison damage by 25%

- |KwuarmSticks+565726489341984779| Kwuarm: Each potency level provides +2.5% weapon poison damage

- |LantaSticks+565726489404899368| Lantadyme: Each potency level increases potion timer by 30 seconds. Not usually cost effective to use but can reduce the need to make more overloads.

- |FellstalkSticks+690987265421213746| Fellstalk (For Slayer): Each potency level provides a x1.01 chance to spawn elite monsters






Incense sticks are rather expensive to use in dangerous pvm due to having to re-incense upon death, so it is advised to only use them in higher level pvm where there benefits are quite tangible for their value or where their cost will be offset by profit. But here is a general list of where you would use certain incense sticks.



|<b>| Kalphite King: |</b>| Spirit Weed, Kwuarm, Lantadyme

|<b>| GWD2: |</b>| Spirit Weed, Kwuarm (at Helwyr and Greg), Lantadyme, Irit (At Greg)

- Priority: ``High``



- |ripperpouch+703581275453128714| Ripper Demon

      - Best DPS familiar

      - Note: Should set the special attacks to occur every 1 attack when scrolls are stored in it

- Priority: ``High``






Bakriminel Bolts  
----------------




Enchanted bakriminel bolts provide various effects which can be very useful in certain pvm scenarios. If you are using DW weapons it is highly recommended that you use bakriminel bolts for increased DPM. Here's a rundown of the current meta. |<i>| If a bolt does not appear on this list, it is not considered meta |</i>| .



|<b>| Ruby bolts |</b>| |RubyBakri+565726489413287956| - Overall best dps bolt for general pvm. 5% chance to activate, replacing a hit with a new one based on target's HP. The bolts have a shared cooldown per target, making them less effective (but still very powerful) in groups. Around ~70k HP, it is recommended to switch to another type of bolt, as ruby bolts can reduce DPS if the bolt damage is less than the original hit.



|<b>| Diamond bolts |</b>| - Improves accuracy. Useful for bosses where you want the extra accuracy above all else (eg. Rise of the Six).



|<b>| Onyx bolts |</b>| |OnyxBakri+565726489362956308| - 10% chance to activate, heals 25% of the hit that triggered activation. Also increases damage by 25% on activation. Great for sustained healing, and alternative bolts after ruby bolts are no longer effective. Expensive.



|<b>| Hydrix bolts |</b>| |HydrixBakri+550834403136503822| - 10% chance to activate, immediately granting 10% adren, and +1% on basics for 15 seconds. Used as a utility bolt for pumping out more thresholds while in Death's Swiftness. |<i>| These are the hardest bolts to use effectively as they require you to improvise a rotation based off of how much adrenaline you gain |</i>| . Very expensive.



Note: Ruby bak bolts are banned from challenge gems as its difficult accurately measure your DPM with their effects.
