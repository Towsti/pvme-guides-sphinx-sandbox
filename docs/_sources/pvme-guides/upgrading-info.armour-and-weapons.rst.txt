armour-and-weapons
==================

Armour  
------












|643166871285137458.png| |<b>| T80 Armour |</b>|

- The standard armour for all PvMing

      - Note: Should just opt for Masterwork over Torva due to it costing significantly less.

- Priority: ``High``






|643847056527458324.png| |<b>| T90 Armour |</b>|

- Better defensive bonuses, as well as marginal dps increase over T80 armour.

- Priority: ``High for Masterwork, Medium for others``






|536966366272552960.png| |<b>| T92 Armour |</b>|

- The best armour. Relatively small defense and dps boost vs T90 armour.

      - Note: Due to repair/upkeep costs, none are worth using outside of Elite Dungeons except for Trimmed Masterwork. As such, |<i>| the following ONLY applies to this armour. Elite Tectonic and Sirenic do not have set effects at this time. |</i>|

      - Note: The Trimmed Masterwork armour's set effect and low upkeep cost is what makes it worthwhile compared to the other T92 armour sets.

      - When wearing 3 or more pieces you will gain 10% damage soak per piece that will be applied as damage over time.

      - Note: Reduces damage of Vengeance recoil, and can negatively impact Reprisal at bosses like Vorago. As both determine their damage from Lifepoints lost, the damage delaying effect can cause them to be less effective.

- Priority: ``Low``

|643214402169864213.png| |<b>| Dominion Tower Gloves |</b>|

- Of these gloves, the only ones that see any niche use in PvM are |<i>| Spellcaster Gloves |</i>| . When casting a basic ability or an auto attack with these worn, there is a 5% chance of the following effect being applied:

Weapons  
-------






|513190159341322240.png| |<b>| T90 Weapons |</b>|



- Note: In general dual-wield camp > 2h camp at bosses due to marginally better single target dps. Using dual-wield also makes shield, Flanking, and Lunging switches easier and more fluid to use. However, one should be using both dual-wield and 2h weapons in order to use abilities that are normally exclusive to either type. 






|<b>| |<u>| Melee |</u>| |</b>|

- Special Attack: |<i>| Crystal Rain |</i>|

      - Costs 30% adrenaline

      - 5 arrows are launched, the first landing a tick before the rest. The first will always have an opportunity to hit, the rest depending on if they land on game tiles the target occupies. If the first splashes, the rest will splash as well.

	    - 30 second cooldown.

      - The damage range of the Spec is based a couple factors, refer to the wiki for specifics: <https://runescape.wiki/w/Seren_godbow#Special_attack>

- Generally used on 3x3+ sized monsters, with IoTH if off-style

- Priority: ``High if you can use spec, Medium otherwise``

- Special Attack: |<i>| Claws of Guthix |</i>|

      - Costs 25% adrenaline

      - Deals 140%-300% (220% average) ability damage

      - Lowers the target's defence by 5% of the previous level and applies a debuff that increases the target's affinity values by 2.

- Use cases are in pretty much all high end pvm encounters where hit chance is not 100%. The special attack is also a fairly strong threshold ability alternative.

      - Note: When using the Guthix Staff special you will lose Aftershock stacks unless you 1 tick your special attack. This should be done regardless, and if possible an auto attack should lead into the special attack.

- Priority: ``High if you use magic``






|641670143197446182.png| |<b>| Statius Warhammer |</b>|
