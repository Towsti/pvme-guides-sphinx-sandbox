armour-and-weapons
==================

Armour
------












 |torvabody|  **T80 Armour**

- The standard armour for all PvMing

      - Note: Should just opt for Masterwork over Torva due to it costing significantly less.

- Priority: ``High``






 |masterworkbody|  **T90 Armour**

- Better defensive bonuses, as well as marginal dps increase over T80 armour.

- Priority: ``High for Masterwork, Medium for others``






 |tmwbody|  **T92 Armour**

- The best armour. Relatively small defense and dps boost vs T90 armour.

      - Note: Due to repair/upkeep costs, none are worth using outside of Elite Dungeons except for Trimmed Masterwork. As such, *the following ONLY applies to this armour. Elite Tectonic and Sirenic do not have set effects at this time.*

      - Note: The Trimmed Masterwork armour's set effect and low upkeep cost is what makes it worthwhile compared to the other T92 armour sets.

      - When wearing 3 or more pieces you will gain 10% damage soak per piece that will be applied as damage over time.

      - Note: Reduces damage of Vengeance recoil, and can negatively impact Reprisal at bosses like Vorago. As both determine their damage from Lifepoints lost, the damage delaying effect can cause them to be less effective.

- Priority: ``Low``






 |achtoprimevaltop|  **Achto**

- T90 tank armour that has a chance to reset all defensive cooldowns when atleast 3 pieces are worn (2% chance per piece worn).

- Increases damage dealt while wearing a shield/shieldbow at 10% of the equivalent offhand weapon damage based on the shield's level.

- Generally only use in situations where the cooldown reset is useful, or tanking damage has higher importance than the damage you deal.

- Priority: ``Low``






 |Cinderbanes|  **Cinderbanes**

- BiS gloves for poisonable targets

- Increases the damage poison hits would deal, as well as being able to refresh and proc damage itself

- Priority: ``High if you can use them, Low otherwise``






 |NMG|  **Nightmare Gauntlets**

- Passive Effect:

      - A 25% increased hitchance when using Snipe

      - Allows you to move whilst using Snipe

      - A bug that lets you 3-tick cast Snipe when using ability queuing as opposed to 4-tick casting without.

- Priority: ``High``






 |DTB|  **Deathtouch Bracelet**

- Passive Effect:

      - 1/5 chance of reflecting 25-50% damage (~7.5% average reflected) back to the attacker.

      - Note: Unlike the Reflect ability, this does not actually reduce damage received.

- Priority: ``High``






 |spellcaster|  **Dominion Tower Gloves**

- Of these gloves, the only ones that see any niche use in PvM are *Spellcaster Gloves*. When casting a basic ability or an auto attack with these worn, there is a 5% chance of the following effect being applied:

      - Dealing 25% more damage

      - Binding the target

      - Lowering the target's Magic, Attack, Range, and Defense by 7 levels (does not stack)

      - Delayed abilities (e.g. blitz spells, sonic) will instantly hit the target

- Only really sees use at Vorago

- Priority: ``Low for Spellcasters, Very Low for others``






 |detoboots|  **Blast Diffusion Boots**

- Halves the charge time of the Detonate ability.

- Generally used as another main threshold for magic. Usually a 3-tick Detonate for 80% charged Detonate (4-tick Detonate is usually only used for its 5x5 AoE)

- Priority: ``High``






 |Laceration|  **Laceration Boots**

- Allows Bladed Dive to be used with only a mainhand or 2h melee weapon

- Priority: ``Medium``






Weapons
-------






 |noxscythe|  **T90 Weapons**



- Note: In general dual-wield camp > 2h camp at bosses due to marginally better single target dps. Using dual-wield also makes shield, Flanking, and Lunging switches easier and more fluid to use. However, one should be using both dual-wield and 2h weapons in order to use abilities that are normally exclusive to either type. 






:bold-underline:`Melee`

 |noxscythe|  **Noxious Scythe**

- BiS halberd-range weapon. Good for AoE and staying out of melee distance.

- Special Attack: *Mirrorback*

      - Costs 100% adrenaline

      - Summons a mirrorback spider with 10,000 LP that reduces all damage taken by 50%, reflecting it back to the attacker. The spider is also dealt the same damage.

      - Completely useless in the current game.

- Priority: ``High``



 |drygorelongmh|  **Drygores**

- Note: All Drygore variants will be the same overall dps, maces however will allow you to 5taa should the need arise.

- Priority: ``High``






:bold-underline:`Magic`

 |noxstaff|  **Noxious Staff**

- Special Attack: *Mirrorback*

      - Costs 100% adrenaline

      - Summons a mirrorback spider with 10,000 LP that reduces all damage taken by 50%, reflecting it back to the attacker. The spider is also dealt the same damage.

      - Completely useless in the current game.

- Priority: ``High``



 |seiswand|  **Seismic Wand and Singularity**

- Priority ``High``






:bold-underline:`Ranged`

 |noxbow|  **Noxious Longbow**

- Note: Can make kiting easier due to longer range than Ascension crossbows.

- Special Attack: *Mirrorback*

      - Costs 100% adrenaline

      - Summons a mirrorback spider with 10,000 LP that reduces all damage taken by 50%, reflecting it back to the attacker. The spider is also dealt the same damage.

      - Completely useless in the current game.

- Priority: ``Low``



 |ascmh|  **Ascension Crossbows**

- Typically used with bakriminel bolts making them superior to 2h bows in almost all scenarios.

- Priority: ``High``






 |zgs|  **T92 Weapons**

:bold-underline:`Melee`

 |zgs|  **Zaros Godsword**

- Special Attack: *Blackhole*

      - Costs 50% adrenaline

      - Lasts 21 seconds (35 ticks), with a 60 second cooldown.

      - Creates a 7x7 area that boosts all melee damage by 25%. Enemies positioned within this area take 25%-50% ability damage every 1.8 seconds (3 ticks).

- Priority: ``High``



 |masterworkspearofannihilation|  **Masterwork Spear of Annihilation**

- Passive Effect: Increases duration of melee bleed abilities by 50%.

      - Only affects Dismember, Slaughter, and Blood Tendrils. *Damage over time from the Greater Barge effect is not extended by this weapon.*

      - 2 hits are added to each bleed resulting in 7 total hits.

      - Stacks with Strength Cape perk for Dismember, resulting in 10 total hits.

      - Interacts strangely with Blood Tendrils; Two smaller hits are added to the start of the bleed, and self damage doesn't occur until the fifth hit.

- Priority: ``HIGH`` 



 |khopeshmh|  **Khopesh of Tumeken and Khopesh of Elidinis**

- Priority: ``Medium``

      - The damage range of the Spec is based a couple factors, refer to the wiki for specifics: <https://runescape.wiki/w/Seren_godbow#Special_attack>

- Generally used on 3x3+ sized monsters, with IoTH if off-style

- Priority: ``High if you can use spec, Medium otherwise``

      - Deals 140%-300% (220% average) ability damage

      - Lowers the target's defence by 5% of the previous level and applies a debuff that increases the target's affinity values by 2.

- Use cases are in pretty much all high end pvm encounters where hit chance is not 100%. The special attack is also a fairly strong threshold ability alternative.

      - Note: When using the Guthix Staff special you will lose Aftershock stacks unless you 1 tick your special attack. This should be done regardless, and if possible an auto attack should lead into the special attack.
