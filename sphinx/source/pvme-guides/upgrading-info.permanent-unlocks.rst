Permanent Unlocks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^





 |berserker|   |mani|   |reckless|  **Berserk Auras**

- Costs  |MarksofWar|  25,000 Marks of War

- BIS auras at most places, they last 30 minutes but are extended to 1 hour via vis wax. Provide the following buffs:

      • These auras provide an invisible 10% boost to the player's melee/magic/range damage and accuracy respectively; this does not stack with damage boosting ultimates

      • The respective combat level is also increased by 10%. With a supreme overload, this results in a level of 128

      • You will also receive 15% more melee, magic, ranged and soft typeless damage. Hard typeless is unaffected

      • In addition to this your defence level is reduced by 15%

- They should be used in any bossing encounter where you do not have 100% accuracy; and optionally any time you wish to deal more damage with a specific style  

- Priority: `High`

      • These should be the first auras you unlock, start with the combat style you use the most then move on to the remaining two before getting other auras





 |brawler|   |runic|   |sharp|  **Accuracy Auras**

- Costs  |loyaltypoint|  107,000 Loyalty Points per aura (cumulative cost for supreme variant)

- Increase melee/magic/range accuracy by 3%/5%/7%/10% per rank respectively. They last 1 hour by default and can be extended to 2 hours

- Reasonable option if zerk auras are on cooldown and you do not have 100% accuracy

- Priority: `Low` Only get these after you have all berserk auras, either way these will likely see little use





 |mahj|   |dm|  **Mahjarrat & Dark Magic Aura**

- Dark Magic costs  |MarksofWar|  12,500 Marks of War

- Mahjarrat costs either  |Reaperpoints|  1000 Reaper Points or  |Bond|  3 Bonds

- Mahjarrat provides a 5% damage boost and Dark magic deals damage over time to your target

- These are used in cases where you hybrid and already have 100% accuracy

- Priority: `Medium, High if you intend to camp solak/Elite dungeons`



 |inspiration|   |invig|  **Inspiration & Invigorate Aura**

- Inspiration costs  |loyaltypoint|  23,000 Loyalty Points

- Invigorate costs  |loyaltypoint|  115,000 Loyalty Points (cumulative cost for supreme variant)

- Inspiration causes successful attacks to give an extra 0.5% adrenaline. Invigorate saves 2.5%/5%/7.5%/10% adrenaline after an ultimate; this effect stacks with a ring of vigour

- These auras can be used as a last resort option for bosses you already have 100% accuaracy. Alternatively they can be used for elite dungeons or slayer, but are still inferior to berserk auras

- Priority: `Medium/Low`



 |penance|   |vamp|  **Penance & Vampyrism Aura**

- Vampyrism costs  |MarksofWar|  5,000 Marks of War

- Penance costs  |loyaltypoint|  23,000 Loyalty Points

- Penance restores prayer points equal to 5% of any damage taken, rounded down.

- Vampyrism restores life points equal to 5% of any damage dealt; this is capped at 50 life points per hit.

- Very low usage for bossing and are mainly used for slayer

- Priority: `Low`







 |Explosivecomp|   |Armadylcomp|   |cywircomp|   |Ilujankancomp|  **Invention (Lvl 49/74/89)**

- Higher invention levels give you access to new components and perks. Important milestones are level 49/74/89 giving you crackling, precise, and planted feet/aftershock 

       (Ilujankan & Cywir also require 2,500 reputation in their respective GWD2 boss)

       • Crackling deals 50% ability damage per rank every 60 seconds

       • Precise increases your minimum damage by 1.5% per rank of your maximum damage.

       • Planted Feet causes the duration of Sunshine and Death's Swiftness to be increased by 25%

       • Aftershock deals additional AoE damage for every 50,000 damage the player deals

- These basic perks should be used in any general combat scenario as they are unlocked early and provide a substantial boost to DPS

- Priority: `High`







 |elderovlsalve|  **Overloads/Supreme Overloads/Elder Overloads**

- Overloads increase a players combat stats + 15% of the stat level + 3

      • Supreme overloads increase a players combat stats + 16% of the stat level + 4 `(128 at 99 + berserker aura)`

      • Elder overloads increase a players combat stats + 17% of the stat level + 5 `(130 at 99 + berserker aura)`

- The stat boost is significant in every combat scenario for additional damage and accuracy

- Priority: `High`

      • These should be one the first unlocks to get if you want to do any sort of PVM







 |turmoil|   |torment|   |anguish|  **T95 Curses**

- Turmoil, torment and anguish provide combat boosts for melee/mage/range respectively

- Costs  |coins|  $data_pvme:Unlocks!B13$ per prayer

- Stronger versions of the level 95 variants that does the following:

       • drains enemy -8 to -12 levels (for accuracy)

       • -8 to -12 enemy drain modifier (for armour)

       • -9% to -15% enemy damage



- Priority: `High`

      • Heals 4% of your max hp 5 times over 20 seconds with Hard Seers' Diaries completed for a total of 20% hp restoration

- Priority: `Medium`





 |HoodedMax|  **Max Cape Perks**

- The max and comp capes can fit 3 perks, and the combatants cape can fit two. Generally, the following perks should be prioritized:

      •  |Defence|  This is a must, as it acts as a sign of life and frees up your pocket slot for much more useful items. It also saves you an inventory slot as you do not need portent of life.

      •  |Strength|  Dismember hits 3 more times (from 5 to 8), effectively increasing its damage by 60%. Very powerful with Lunging perk. Only useful if meleeing, can skip if you do not melee.

      •  |Constitution|  Useful for healing at bank as well as regen throughout fights, though the effect is rather minimal. Scales with maximum HP.

      •  |Ranged|  Ammo proc chance is increased by 20%. For example, the base chance of ruby bakriminel (e) proccing is 5%. This cape boosts it to 6% (20% of 5% is +1%). Only useful if ranging, can skip if you do not range.

	  •  |Attack| / |Invention|  The impact these have on upkeep costs is relatively minimal, and these capes are mostly just filler; the combatants cape cannot have invention on it.





**Permanent Access to Nex Bank**

- Players can speak to Ashuelot Reis in the Nex Bank with a set of ancient ceremonial robes, a frozen key and 10,000,000 coins to allow for permanent access to Nex's lobby.
